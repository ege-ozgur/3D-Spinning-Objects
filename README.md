# Simple DX12 Renderer

A basic 3D rendering engine built from scratch using **C++** and **DirectX 12**.

This project serves as an exploration into the DX12 pipeline, featuring:
- Window creation using Win32 API.
- Initialization of Direct3D 12 context.
- Rendering of procedural primitive shapes (Cube, Sphere, Plane).
- Custom implementations for Vector and Matrix mathematics.
- Basic HLSL Vertex and Pixel shaders.

### How to Run
Open the project in Visual Studio and build the solution. Requires Windows 10/11 and a GPU with DX12 support.
